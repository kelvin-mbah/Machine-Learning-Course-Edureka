# Linear Regression Notes

Machine learning is AI that lets computers learn from data without being told exactly how.

Regression predicts relationships between variables. Types:
- Linear: Straight-line relationship.
- Logistic: For yes/no outcomes.
- Polynomial: Curved relationships.

Linear assumes a straight line between inputs and output.

In this practical, we used Boston housing data to predict house prices (medv) from features like rooms (rm) and crime rate (crim).

Steps: Split data, check correlations, fix multicollinearity with VIF, build model, optimize model, predict, and plot results.
